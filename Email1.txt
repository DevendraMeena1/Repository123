Hello World!

Case 1: PRODSUP-001:

Hi Harry,

I have received your support request ,you will require to make below changes inorder to show up test cases:

1) Files in CircumCI are case sensitive , So please change Circle.yml to circle.yml 


2) You need clear you circle.yml file and add below lines:

test:
  post:
    - mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/
    - find . -type f -regex ".*/target/surefire-reports/.*xml" -exec cp {} $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/ \;


2) You need to turn on Maven Surefire Plugin in pov.xml file 
 
 Please remove below line of code from pov.xml , this will activate the Plugin

<configuration>
   <skip>true</skip>
</configuration>
